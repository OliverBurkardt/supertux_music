# supertux_music

This is an enhanced menu-theme for Supertuxcart, staying true to its original melody.

The file is a dry export from MuseScore without any effects (pure plugins), of the piece in its current state.

One goal is to make this piece an open source collaborative effort, like the game code as well, using the open source music notation software MuseScore.

This Music-Rescore:

    is specifically intended for Supertuxcart.
    is based on the Supertuxcart-Menu-Theme by Claude Werner, giving him credit, incorporating his efforts and expanding on his idea.
    is a work in progress bringing more of a cartoon-style, speed (crack-style) and a touch of epicness to the table.
    is loopable
    is intentionally produced in an open format .mscz with the open source software MuseScore, so others may refine it aswell, If it would be to be accepted.
    is intentionally,for development and preview purposes, currently mixed down without enhancing effects (delay/reverb) as a flat and dry mp3 (encapsulated in mp4 for uploadability), to convey the actual state of the arrangement.

If the developers and the community accept this piece as an enhancement, I would continue to refine it and produce and mix it in studio quality.
Furthermore, it shall be open for others to refine and would be subsequently remixed twice a year, if an update or an enhancement has been made in the .mscz file.

Please give your feedback, if this piece and a future collaborative writing style would be an improvement or of interest.

Kind Regards
Oliver
